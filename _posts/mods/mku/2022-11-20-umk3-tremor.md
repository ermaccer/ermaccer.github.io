Skin for Jax which aims to replicate Tremor if he was wearing UMK3 outift using
Scorpion's alternate one. Voice is changed to Shao Kahn one.


This mod replaces Jax special moves with new ones!

- Ground Pound was edited to use different animation and is faster, also starts from ground.
- Machine Gun was replaced with a new stun ball projectile.
- Piston Punches was replaced with a new charge move.
