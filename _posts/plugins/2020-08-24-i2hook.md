## Introduction
I2Hook is a plugin for PC version of Injustice 2.

**I2Hook only works with latest Steam version!**

## Features

| | **Menu Features**|

|Cheats| All cheats can be toggled for both P1 and P2: Infinite Health, Zero Health|
|Misc.| Completely disable all HUD elements. |



## NOTE

Since some people might use this plugin for 60 fps patch only, I've added an option in the .ini which activates FPS patch only and ignores all other features. Set **b60FPSModeOnly** in ini to true to enable.
