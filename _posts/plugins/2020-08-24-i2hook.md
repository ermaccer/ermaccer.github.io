## Introduction
I2Hook is a plugin for PC version of Injustice 2.

**It only supports latest Steam version!**


## Features

### Character Modifier
 - You can play as anyone in any game mode, this includes NPCs such as Nightwing or boss version 
   of Brainiac.
 
### Camera Control
 - Free Camera
 - Manual Camera Position
 - Pre-set Camera modes: 1ST and 3RD person cameras

### Krypt Control
 - You can change krypt player model to most of available characters
 
### 60 FPS Patch
 - Injustice 2 has a 30 fps cap for frontend menus, super moves and intros, with this plugin it can be unlocked to 60
 - **If your PC does not meet requirement specs, turning this option on might have negative impact on perfomance!**

##NOTE
 **Since some people might use this plugin for 60 fps patch only, I've added an option in the .ini which activates FPS patch only and ignores all other features. Set b60FPSModeOnly in ini to true to enable.
