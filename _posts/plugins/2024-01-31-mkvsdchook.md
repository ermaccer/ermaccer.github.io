| L Stick |  Movement|
| R Stick |  Rotation|

### Note

To restore camera to previous state, press R3 then perform a Klose Kombat grab to reset the camera!


# Installation 

MKVSDCHook was only tested with Xenia Canary, no testing on real X360 was done but technically should work.

In `xenia-canary.config.toml`, set `allow_plugins` to true, then extract the archive into the main Xenia Canary folder.
If done correctly notification will pop up on game launch.
