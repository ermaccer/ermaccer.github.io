# Modloader
Modloader is a feature inspired by GTA Modloader by Link,
it is not as powerful as the GTA version but it is still pretty useful.

What isn't supported?

Currently, MH Modloader doesn't support swapping:

- INI
- PAK
- Any audio file 

How to load mods?

It depends on type, but every mod needs a folder.
Create a folder with any name inside modloader folder.

MH Modloader comes with a custom DFF loader which allows
to load multiple .dff files and append them to the model list.

Some files are ignored from beign loaded, they are specified
in modloader.ini file.

By default, your .dff filename cannot be gmodelspc.dff or modelscpc.dff.
Model require txds to be loaded too, how to load texture for custom models?
You'll need a filename with .txd extension which is the same as the model name.
eg.
Katana.dff requires Katana.txd.

So, how to load model mods?

Example folder tree:

```
---- My Custom Katana
-------Katana.dff
-------Katana.txd
```

The .dff file will be loaded and any model that it replaces will 
be replaced.


Swapping normal files

To swap normal files, you'll need to recreate the original path.

Example folder tree
```
---- My Custom Loading
-------pictures
--------TITLE
---------title_pc.txd
```

The file will be loaded in place of the original.

You can view list of loaded mods in the "Modifications" menu.
