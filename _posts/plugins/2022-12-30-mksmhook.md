<div class="alert bg-dark">
    MKSMHook only supports SLUS21087 version of the game!
</div>


# Features
- Free Camera
- Change game mode to any possible at any point in time!
- Access to original debug menu
- NPC selection on select screen



# Notes

## NPCs
Press Down or Up on VS/Koop/Single player screen to change character slot ID!

All NPCs are playable in single player, in versus mode, only a select few work due to the fact they
need to be set up for this mode. If an invalid character is used for versus, the game won't load.

Some challenges might softlock the game, such as fatality ones. To get around it, enable Ko-Op mode
and finish the challenge using Liu Kang or Kung Lao as P2.

## Camera
Rotating camera way too the left or right will break it, sometimes you might need to rotate it around to fix movement/rotation.
Looks like some engine flaw.
