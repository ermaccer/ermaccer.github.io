<p align="center">A plugin for Manhunt 2 which features first person mode, 60 FPS patch and more!</p>



# Features

| Feature | Description | 
|     ---      |   ---        | 
| **60 FPS Patch** |  Removes 30 fps cap. | 
| **Clean Headshots** | Changes headshot behaviour to be more like the first Manhunt, long distance headshots can be performed and heads won't explode unless the weapon is any shotgun or sniper rifle. | 
| **Firearms Executions Unlock** | Allows firearms to use all 3 execution levels.  |
| **Decals Fix** | Fixes decals disappearing as soon as they hit the ground/solid object. | 
| **First Person Mode** | Allows to play the game in first person perspective. | 
| **Misc.** | PluginMH2 also adds several other options, this includes an option to disable camera shake, restore rats (cockroaches) and skip legal screen. FOV (field of view) can be changed too. |

## Usage
Enable it in .ini first (**bEnableFirstPersonMode**), then while in game press the lookaround/first person mode key (**T** is the default key) or
simply move the camera around.

Due to how MH2 works, either a static like camera (which has no Y axis movement and restricts mouse) or 360 camera can be used at a time. To
temporarily switch to the 360 camera, hold **Z** (can be changed in PluginMH2.ini). This will allow full mouse movement to an extend. 
Aiming will automatically toggle 360 camera as long as aim is held.


*First person executions can be enabled by enabling bDisableExecutionCamera in the INI.*
