# Installation 

## 1. SilentPatch

needed for ScarfaceHook.

# Usage

If installed correctly, a notification will appear informing that the plugin was installed
and is ready to use. By default **F1** will open or close in-game menu.


# Configuration


<div class="alert bg-dark">
 INI options can be configured in the menu's settings submenu. If you are not familiar with .ini files, use Settings menu.
</div>




ScafaceHook can be configured using ScarfaceHook.ini file - you can open it with any text editor.


If you are not sure what to type where, here's a quick reference guide:

**b** - option can be true or false

**i** - option can be any number in decimal (1) or hex format (0x1)

All options have a comment attached to them.


# Notes
- Invincibility doesn't seem to affect fall damage when using Airbreak, it "fixes" itself after dying though
- High Priority loading option should be used only if something really doesn't want to load
- Planes/Helicopters can be spawned but they cannot be controlled, do not enter planes, it's not possible to exit them
