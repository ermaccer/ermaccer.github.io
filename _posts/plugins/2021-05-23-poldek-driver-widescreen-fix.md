## Introduction
This is a plugin which adds support for 16:9 widescreen to Poldek Driver.

Why 16:9 only?
The game abuses odd textures, engine draws them with allocated sizes, but it's
tough to position them.

3D aspect ratio is changed, so if you don't like 2D scaling, it's possible
to disable it in INI file.

Plugin also adds an option to skip intro movie and ads.

**This plugin was tested only with Polish 1.1 retail release!**
